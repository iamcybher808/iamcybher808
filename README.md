I love tackling tasks that involve solving problems. I'm interested in topics such as Threat Hunting, Threat Intelligence, and Detection Engineering.
## Objective
I am a career changer; my focus was on understanding the human body and its functions. I am now passionate about computers and how they work. The tables have turned, but the same method applies. My goal is to help companies maintain a healthy state/environment. If you understand the concept of body function, then maintaining the knowledge of computers is not far off.  

## Projects
I hope to create or contribute to open-source projects.
