Currently, I am a Threat hunter. I love tackling tasks that involve solving problems. I'm interested in topics such as Phishing, Threat Hunting, Threat Intelligence, and Detection Engineering. 

## Objective
I am a career changer; my focus was understanding the human body and its functions. Now, I am passionate about computers and how they function. The tables have turned, but the same method applies. My goal is to help companies maintain a healthy state/environment. If you understand the concept of body function, then maintaining the knowledge of computers is not far along.
